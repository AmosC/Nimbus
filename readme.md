Nimbus
======



Nimbus is a .NET client library to add an easy to develop against experience
against the Azure Service Bus.



If you've used NServiceBus or MassTransit before, you'll be right at home.



Nimbus was designed to be lightweight and pluggable. You won't find 50
conflicting versions of other projects ILMerged into the binary, if you want to
plug your own container or logging framework in, go right ahead. However if you
want something that will just work out of the box we give you that too.



Nimbus provides implementations of all of the common messaging patterns for
building distributed, service-oriented systems.
